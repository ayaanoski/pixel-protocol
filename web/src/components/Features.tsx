They are issued by dApps after a successful interaction, creating an immutable record of financial responsibility, work history, or educational attainment. A user's reputation is the sum of these VCs, which they fully own and control.",

      description: "We move beyond a single, static number. The Pixel Protocol reputation score is a dynamic, on-chain value that can be weighted differently depending on the use case. A lending dApp can calculate a score based on repayment history VCs, while a decentralized marketplace can prioritize VCs related to positive reviews and completed projects.",

While VCs are publicly verifiable, users can leverage Zero-Knowledge Proofs to prove they meet specific criteria (e.g., "I have a positive repayment history") without revealing the specific details of their credentials. This allows for trust without compromising sensitive personal data.',
